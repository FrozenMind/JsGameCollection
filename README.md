# JsGameCollection
Here we build small games with the easlejs Framework (http://www.createjs.com/easeljs). Most of the games are old 8 bit or small games. 
<br>For bigger games we are going to create own Repositorys and link them here.
<br>For some of these games (maybe all) we're going to create a multiplayer mode
<br>You can play these games on our Website: (coming soon)
